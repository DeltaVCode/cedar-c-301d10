# Code 301: Intermediate Software Development

Welcome to Code 301! This class builds on your 201 foundation with a deep dive into the world of servers. Using React, Node.js, npm libraries, and Bootstrap, this class prepares you for 401.

## Overview

Code 301 begins with front end development using React and Bootstrap. Module 2 introduces the back-end and building servers to serve files to a React front-end. Module 3 brings everything together with the development of a full-stack application from start to finish. The final module is team-based project work.
